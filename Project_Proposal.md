# Expectations
I think everytrhing ive listed above is realistic. A few of the items i have planned might be a bit difficult but all the more fun for it. I may also produce some music for it, or have a friend do so. If i do i will of course credit him. The controller support is only if i get some extra time or it turns out to be fairly simple
